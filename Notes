Github Actions

- GitHub Actions is the built-in CI/CD tool from GitHub that lets you automate:
✅ Build
✅ Test
✅ Docker image build
✅ Push to Docker Hub
✅ Deploy to Kubernetes


# github actions==CI/CD pipelineing tool

## CI = continuous integration
Continuous Integration (CI) means:
Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository, and every change is automatically built and tested.

🔥 What happens in CI?
When you push code to GitHub:
✅ Code is pulled
✅ Dependencies are installed
✅ Tests are executed
✅ Build is created (e.g., Docker image)
❌ If tests fail → pipeline fails

🎯 Goal of CI: Catch bugs early before we do the merge.
🎯 CI does:  Push → Run tests → Build Docker image → Push to Docker Hub



## CD = continous deployment  (or Continuous Delivery)
There are two meanings people confuse:
1️⃣ Continuous Delivery- build+test+approval to deploy
Code is automatically prepared for release,but manual approval is needed to deploy.
2️⃣ Continuous Deployment -build+test+deploy
Code is automatically deployed to production without manual approval.

🎯 CD does:New Docker image → Deploy to Kubernetes cluster automatically


🎯 CI/CD -pipleline is managed by github actions -and github action is the tool used to build , test , deploy the application automatically.


## Workflow file in github action
- A Workflow in GitHub Actions:
✅ It is a YAML (.yml) file
✅ Contains automation instructions for your project
✅ Stored inside: .github/workflows/your-file.yml

- It defines:
When to run (Events)
What to run (Jobs)
How to run (Steps)

## Events/triggres:
- triggres are used to run the yml Triggers define when the workflow should run.
- Common triggers:
on:
  push:    -- When code is pushed
  pull_request:   --- When PR is created/updated
  workflow_dispatch:   --- Manual trigger
  schedule:     ---Runs on cron schedule

## JOB:
A Job:
- Is a group of steps
- Runs on a machine
- That machine is called a Runner
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

🖥 Runner
- Runner = Machine where job executes
- Types: ubuntu-latest , windows-latest , macos-latest

## steps:
- A Job is divided into Steps.
- Each step performs a small task like:
   -- Checkout code
   -- Install Python
   -- Install dependencies
   -- Run tests 
   -- Build Docker image

🎯 Interview Ready Definition

A GitHub Actions workflow is a YAML file stored inside .github/workflows/ that defines automated CI/CD pipelines. It contains triggers (events), jobs, and steps that run on a runner machine.
